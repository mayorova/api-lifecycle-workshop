### Chapter 11

# Develop

In the **Develop** phase, third parties will start discovering your APIs and developing applications based on your APIs. The user experience of those applications will depend on the quality of your APIs but also on the client applications. Make sure you are providing enough resources for developers to get the most out of your APIs. Those resources can be best practices, information on how to handle security and retries on errors, and so on.
