## Help ACME get feedback on the Brewery API!

Since the beginning of this workshop, ACME released two versions of its API, customers are started using them and it is now time to think about the next iteration. In this exercise, you will help ACME set a feedback loop to know what to improve next.

- Open your **3scale Admin Portal** by copying this URL in your web browser and changing the `userXY` by your actual username.

```raw
{{< param 3scale_admin_portal_url >}}
```

- Go to **Beer Catalog API (PROD, v1.0)** (top dropdown list)
- Click **Analytics**, **Usage**
- Answer this question: **What is the most used method if the ACME Brewery API ?**
- Click **Response Codes**
- Answer this question: **Is the ACME Brewery API in good health?**

To complete your understanding, explain **how ACME could get insights on how much beers have been exchanged through their API**.
