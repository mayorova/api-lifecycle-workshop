### Chapter 8

# Secure

The **Secure** phase is a reminder that security is a key step in the API lifecycle. Automated security testing, such as static analysis or vulnerability testing, should be part of your CD pipeline. Secure development practices, such as code reviews, a security development lifecycle, or OWASP Top 10 should also be part of your development lifecycle.
