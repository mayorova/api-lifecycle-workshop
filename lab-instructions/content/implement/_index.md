### Chapter 6

# Implement

In the **Implement** phase, the actual API is **developed** using either an integration framework such as Red Hat Fuse or using the development language of your choice. Using an integration framework should be a key part of your APIsâ€™ lifecycle to promote reuse, fast iterations, and value additions through orchestration. It also helps to modernize the existing parts of your information system. The usual agile development practices apply here.
