## Create two environments: TEST and PROD!

The ACME Brewery API is implemented and conform to our specification. We can now envision a deployment in all the ACME environments.

Let's start by provisioning a TEST and a PROD environments.

- Open the [OpenShift Web Console]({{< param openshift_console_url >}}/console/catalog)
- In the top-left dropdown box, select the `Beer Catalog (TEST)` project
- In the top-right corner, select **Add to project**, then **Select from project**.
- Select the `Beer Catalog environment` template and click **Next**
