## Craft the API contract of the ACME Brewery API!

The ACME brewery is about to adopt APIs **in order to expose their catalog and inventory** to the outside world. Help them design an API contract!

- Open the [APICurio Studio]({{< param apicurio_studio_url >}}/apis/import)
- Register if you are a newcomer or login if you already have an account
- Copy [this URL](beer-catalog-1.0.json) and import it in APIcurio
- Study the existing design
- Invite one of your colleague
- **Together**, complete it with a method to place an order

Optional, you can publish it on your GIT repository if your have one.

To complete your understanding, explain **how the collaborative features help Developers, future Customers and the Product Owners to refine an API Contract**!
