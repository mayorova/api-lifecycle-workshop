### Chapter 10

# Discover

When your APIs are deployed in production and they are “live,” you enter the **Discover** phase. In this phase, you need to help your partners and other third parties discover your APIs. Just like your corporate website is the showroom for your products and offerings, an API developer portal is a showroom for your APIs. Make sure you put as much effort into this showroom as you do for your corporate website if you want to drive revenue through APIs!
