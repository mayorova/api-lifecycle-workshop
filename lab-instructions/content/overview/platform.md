In this exercise, we will have a look at the platform hosting this workshop and the different tools we will use throughout the whole API Lifecycle.

Your instructor will now assign you a number. Make sure you write it down since you will need it for all exercises!

All usernames on this platform follow the same scheme: `userXY` where `XY` is the number your instructor assigned to you.
All numbers are two digits long. So with numbers below 10, you will need to add a leading zero.

Example:

- if the number assigned to you is 3, your username is `user03`
- if the number assigned to you is 27, your username is `user27`

First, open the [OpenShift Web Console]({{< param openshift_console_url >}}/console/catalog), click `SSO` and login with your username.

Raise your hand if you have trouble to complete this step! An instructor will come help you promptly.
